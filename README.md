# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! As a data analyst with a specialization in telecommunications, I've leveraged SQL extensively to turn raw data into actionable insights. This portfolio showcases the variety of projects I've worked on utilizing my SQL skills in data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

Here, you'll find a range of projects that demonstrate my abilities in:

- **Writing complex SQL queries** to extract and analyze data
- Using SQL for **data cleaning and preprocessing**
- **Creating and managing databases and tables**
- **Understanding and optimizing SQL queries** for performance
- **Integrating SQL with other tools** like Python, R, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI for comprehensive data analysis

## What to Expect

Each project includes a detailed description of the problem, the SQL techniques used to solve it, and the insights derived from the data. My objective is to show how SQL can be used to make data-driven decisions, and I hope these projects illustrate my skills and my passion for data analytics.
